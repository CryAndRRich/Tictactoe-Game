# Tictactoe-Game
A project to create a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe web game with various variations

## How the website works
The web will first display a screen for entering the names of 2 players

After that will be a screen for selecting the desired game variant (currently there are 3 variants, read [here](https://github.com/CryAndRRich/Tictactoe-Game/blob/main/static/js/README.md)), and after selecting, the game can start immediately!
